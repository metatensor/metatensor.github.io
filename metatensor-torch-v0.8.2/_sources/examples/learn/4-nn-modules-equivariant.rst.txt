Equivariance-preserving ``nn`` modules
======================================

.. py:currentmodule:: metatensor.torch.learn.nn

This example demonstrates the use of convenience modules in metatensor-learn to build
simple equivariance-preserving multi-layer perceptrons.

.. note::

    Prior to this tutorial, it is recommended to read the tutorial on :ref:`using
    convenience modules <learn-tutorial-nn-modules-basic>`, as this tutorial builds on
    the concepts introduced there.

Introduction
------------

Often the targets of machine learning are physical observables with certain
symmetries, such as invariance with respect to translation or equivariance with
respect to rotation (i.e., rotating the input structure means that the target
should be rotated in the same way).

Many successful approaches to these learning tasks use equivariance-preserving
architectures to map equivariant features onto predictions of an equivariant target.

In this example we will demonstrate how to build an equivariance-preserving
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on top of some equivariant features.

Let's load the spherical expansion from the :ref:`first steps tutorial
<core-tutorial-first-steps>`.

As a reminder, these are the coefficients of the spherical-basis decompositions of a
smooth Gaussian density representation of 3D point cloud. In this case, the point
cloud is a set of decorated atomic positions.

The important part here is that these features are block sparse in angular momentum
channel (key dimension ``"o3_lambda"``), with each block having a different behaviour
under rigid rotation by the SO(3) group.

In general, blocks that are invariant under rotation (where ``o3_lambda == 0``) can be
transformed in arbitrary (i.e. nonlinear) ways in the mapping from features to target,
while covariant blocks (where ``o3_lambda > 0``) must be transformed in a way that
preserves the equivariance of the features. The simplest way to do this is to use only
linear transformations for the latter.

Define equivariant target data
------------------------------

Let's build some dummy target data: we will predict a global (i.e. per-system) rank-2
symmetric tensor, which decomposes into ``o3_lambda = [0, 2]`` angular momenta
channels when expressed in the spherical basis. An example of such a target in
atomistic machine learning is the electronic polarizability of a molecule.

Our target will be block sparse with ``"o3_lambda"`` key dimensions equal to [0, 2],
and as this is a real- (not pseudo-) tensor, the inversion sigma (``"o3_sigma"``) will
be +1.

Using equivariant convenience layers
------------------------------------

Now we can build our neural network. Our architecture will consist of separate "block
models", i.e. transformations with separate learnable weights for each block in the
spherical expansion. This is in contrast to the previous tutorial :ref:`nn modules
basic <learn-tutorial-nn-modules-basic>`, where we only had a single block in our
features and targets.

Furthermore, as the features are a per-atom quantity, we will use sparse tensor
operations to sum over the contributions of all atoms in the system to get a per-sytem
prediction. For this we will use ``metatensor-operations``.

Starting simple, let's define the neural network as just a simple linear layer. As
stated before, only linear transformations must be applied to covariant blocks, in
this case those with ``o3_lambda = 2``, while nonlinear transformations can be applied
to invariant blocks where ``o3_lambda = 0``. We will use the
:py:class:`~metatensor.torch.learn.nn.EquivariantLinear` module for this.

We can see by printing the architecture of the ``EquivariantLinear`` module,
that there are 8 'Linear' layers, one for each block. In order to preserve
equivariance, bias is always turned off for all covariant blocks. For
invariant blocks, bias can be switched on or off by passing the boolean
parameter ``bias`` when initializing ``EquivariantLinear`` objects.

The outputs of the ``EquivariantLinear`` module are still per-atom and block sparse in
both "center_type" and "neighbor_type". To get per-system predictions, we can
"densify" the predictions in these key dimensions by moving them to samples,
then taking the sum over all sample dimensions except "system".

Let's inspect the per-block losses using predictions from the trained model. Note that
the model is able to perfectly fit the invariant target blocks, but not the covariant
blocks. This is to be expected, as the target data was generated with random numbers
and is not itself equivariant, making the learning task impossible.

Notice that for invariant blocks, the 'block model' is a nonlinear MLP whereas for
invariant blocks it is the sequential application of two linear layers, without bias.
Re-running the training loop with this new architecture:

With the trained model, let's see the per-block decomposition of the loss. As before,
the model can perfectly fit the invariants, but not the covariants, as expected.

Conclusion
----------

This tutorial has demonstrated how to build equivariance-preserving architectures
using the metatensor-learn convenience neural network modules. These modules, such as
``EquivariantLinear`` and ``InvariantReLU`` are modified analogs of the standard
convenience layers, such as ``Linear`` and ``ReLU``.

The key difference is that the invariant or covariant nature (via the "o3_lambda" key
dimension) of the input blocks are taken into account, and used to determine the
transformations applied to each block.
