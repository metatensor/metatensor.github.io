        "\n\n# Managing gradients\n\nAnother big difference between metatensor and other more generic data storage formats is\nits ability to store and manipulate one or more gradients of the data together with the\ndata itself. In this tutorial, we will see how and where gradients are stored, and what\none can do with them.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Metatensor supports multiple ways of managing gradients: explicit forward gradients,\n    presented in this tutorial; and implicit backward mode gradients (only when the data\n    is stored in :py:class:`torch.Tensor`). Both can be mixed as well, to compute\n    backward mode gradients of explicit forward mode gradients when training a model\n    with gradient data (forces and virial).\n\n    In general, the explicit forward gradients presented here are mainly relevant to you\n    if you are working within the numpy ecosystem; and the implicit backward gradients\n    are more interesting if you are working in the PyTorch ecosystem.\n\n    .. TODO add tutorial explaining the difference in more details and link to it here</p></div>\n\nThe code used to generate :download:`spherical-expansion.npz` is in `the first\ntutorial <core-tutorial-first-steps>`, and the code for :download:`radial-spectrum.npz`\nis shown `in the second <core-tutorial-sparsity>`.
